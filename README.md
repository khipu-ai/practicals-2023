[JAX, Optax, Haiku and CNN](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/jax_optax_haiku_cnn.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/jax_optax_haiku_cnn.ipynb) | This tutorial covers the prerequisites for the rest of the practicals: JAX, Optax and Haiku are high performance libraries for computation, optimization and model learning. We then introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and show how to train a deep convolutional model using the aforementioned tools.  | 
[Transformers and Attention](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/attention_and_transformers.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/attention_and_transformers.ipynb) | _Attention_ is a mechanism whereby a model can _focus_ on parts of the input data that are relevant to perform its inference. The _Transformer_ architecture [Vaswani et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762?amp=1) provides an effective and versatile method to implement the concept of Attention in Deep Networks. Arguably, Transformes have become the de-facto architecture for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but can can also be applied in various domains reaching state-of-the-art performance, including computer vision and reinforcement learning. In this practical, we will introduce attention in greater detail and build the entire transformer architecture block by block. | 
[Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/graph_neural_networks.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/graph_neural_networks.ipynb) | In this tutorial, we will be learning about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a topic which has exploded in popularity in both research and industry. We will start with a refresher on graph theory, then dive into how GNNs work from a high level. Next we will cover some popular GNN implementations and see how they work in practice. | 
[Deep Generative Models](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/deep_generative_models.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/deep_generative_models.ipynb) | Generative models are unsupervised methods which whose purpose is to generate new samples akin to those seen in the training dataset. Deep learning has taken these models to a new level with the introduction of architectures such as GANs, VAEs, Flow-based models and Diffusion Models. This practical will walk you through the challenges involved in developing an effective generative model for the particular case of  _Denoise Diffusion Models_ (a.k.a. a Score-Based Generative Model), the backbone of the recent and exciting [Dalle-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) models that we’ve all seen on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dalle2%20%23imagen&src=typed_query). |
[Intro to Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/reinforcement_learning.ipynb) <br /> <br /> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khipu-ai/practicals-2023/blob/main/notebooks/reinforcement_learning.ipynb) | In Reinforcement Learning (RL),  an _agent_ is trained to take the best actions in an environment so as to maximize a given reward in the long run. RL has seen tremendous success on a wide range of challenging problems such as learning to play complex video games like [Atari](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark), [StarCraft II](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) and [Dota II](https://openai.com/five/). In this introductory tutorial we will explore various RL approaches for solving the classic [CartPole](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/), an inverted pendulum system, where an agent must learn to balance a vertical pole by displacing the cart.| 
[Social Impacts of Artificial Intelligence](#) <br /> <br />  | The target of this practical session is to provide tools to explore and measure bias in natural language processing artifacts, namely word embeddings and large language models. Our focus is to assess the generative capabilities of language models and their relationship to human rights, more specifically, their potential harms with respect to reproduction of stereotypes, invisibilization and discrimination.|
