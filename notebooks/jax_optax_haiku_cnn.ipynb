        "\n",
        "## Topics\n",
        "\n",
        "* We begin by introducing **JAX**, a library that allows for very efficient speedups in numerical operations by transparently choosing the best available hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.) and provinding with a number of acceleration and automation mechanisms such as automatic differentiation (`grad`), parallelization (`pmap`), vectorization (`vmap`) and just-in-time compilation (`jit`).\n",
        "\n",
        "* The next step is [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax) library: an efficient JAX-based optimization library.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The last library in the stack is [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku): an object-oriented library  for building and training neural networks based on JAX and Optax.\n",
        "\n",
        "* We then move on to Convolutional Neural Networks: a fundamental component in modern DL.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "This practical assumes that you are familiar with:\n",
        "* Python and NumPy\n",
        "* Basic object oriented programming\n",
        "* Basic optimization (gradient descent, etc.)\n",
        "* Basic model learning (linear models)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hardware requirements (**important**)\n",
        "\n",
        "For this practical, you will need to use a TPU or GPU to speed up training. To do this, go to the \"Runtime\" menu in Colab, select \"Change runtime type\" and then in the popup menu, choose either \"TPU\" (preferrable) or \"GPU\" in the \"Hardware accelerator\" box.\n",

This means that, if you pass some object to a function, the object itself is never changed: a new object is returned. In fact, no other variable or inner state of the machine can be changed within the function.\n",

The simplest ones are grayscale images, where a pixel is a single scalar value (e.g., 254) where the value 0 is black and the value 255 is white (if pixels are floating point values, the convention is that 0.0 is black and 1.0 is white). \n",
        "\n",
        "In general, however, an image can have several _channels_. Typical color images have three channels: red, green and blue (RGB - generally in that order). In such cases, an RGB pixel's value is a _vector_ of three values `[r,g,b]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "More generally, an _hyperspectral image_ (e.g., with infrared bands) can have any number of channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The convention used in Python image processing/computer vision/machine learning libraries is to represent images as _three-dimensional tensors_. There are two conventions:  _channels first_ and _channels last_. As the name implies, a _channels first_ image is a $c{\\times}h{\\times}w$ array where $h$ and $w$ are the height and width of the image, and $c$ is the number of channels. So for example, a typical 640x480 RGB image will have dimensions 3x640x480.\n",

An output is then produced by weighting the values of this set of pixels depending on the relative position of the pixel within the region. For an input with $c$ channels, we simple assign a set of $c$ different weights to each relative position. The set of values associated to a window is called a _filter_ or _kernel_. \n",

Instead, convolutional layers consist of several (e.g., $k=100$ or $k=200$) such filters. If we consider all the $k$ output maps together, we obtain a multi-channel output pseudo-image where each channel corresponds to the output of a given filter.\n",

On top of that, one also has to make decisions such as what kind of pooling, which activation functions, and what size of convolution to use, among other things. For new and old practitioners of deep learning, these choices can be overwhelming. \n",

For a more detailed and technical description of these models and more see [these slides](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture9.pdf). Reading through these resources should give you insights into why these architectures are successful as well as best practices and current trends for CNNs that will help you design your own architectures.\n",

You'll notices that older architectures such as [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) used a range of convolutions from 7x7 down to 3x3. However, newer architectures such as VGG and ResNet use 3x3 convolutions almost exclusively. In short, the reason is that stacking 3x3 convolutions gives you the same receptive field as a larger convolution but with more non-linearity. \n",
